data_NaCl_sample1_sample2.mat contains all the data obtained in the experiments used in the work:
"Size-Resolved Concentration Estimation of Nanoplastic and Microplastic in Water at Different Salinity with Nanoelectrode Array Sensors", Daniele Goldoni, Luigi Rovati, Luca Selmi, IEEE SENSORS 2024

The data are acquired by the biosensing platofrm described in: https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2861558, and used in several works: https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2020.3032712, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2023.107246, https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2023.3296158
Polystyrene nanoparticles and microparticles of 3 different radii (275 nm, 500 nm, 3180 nm) were polydispersed in NaCl solutions (1 mM, 10 mM, 100 mM), two different particles conncentrations were considered (sample1, sample2)
